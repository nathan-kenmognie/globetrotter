### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

**Almost everything discussed in class was used in this project. From flexboxes, to CSS responsiveness and HTML semantic ordering. I made sure to utalize everything.**

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

**If I had more time I would add more content for each feature like more restaurants to visit, videos of concerts and attractions, and maybe change the gallery to a CSS grid instead of a flexbox.**

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

**Everything went just as I had planned honestly. The only thing that had me waste more time than I would have liked what figuring out how to use flexboxes in a way that allowed my boxes to not only self order, but also resize themselves based on screen size.**
