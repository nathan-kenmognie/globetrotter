            What Is The Climate like?
        </h1>
        <p>
Cameroon has a diverse climate due to its varied geography. The country experiences everything from tropical along the coast, with hot and humid weather, to semi-arid in the far north. The central and southern regions have a tropical rainforest climate with heavy rainfall, especially between May and October. The northern regions are drier, with a savanna climate and a distinct dry season from November to March. Temperatures are generally warm year-round, but can be cooler in the highland areas, such as around Mount Cameroon. This diversity makes Cameroon's climate unique and suitable for a wide range of plants, animals, and activities.        </p>
